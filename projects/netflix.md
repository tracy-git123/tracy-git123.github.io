summary: "Riding on the wave Spotify Wrapped, I was inspired to create 5 data visualisations which summarise my Netflix watching habits for 2023."

If you are unfamiliar with [Spotify Wrapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify_Wrapped) it's an end-of-year review of listening habits on the platform. Despite having a wealth of data, Netflix does not give users any personalised insights into their watching habits so I decided to take on the project for myself and call it Netflix Wrapped.

Netflix Wrapped was written using Python and Matplotlib. Within a week I was able to download my usage data, clean the data and create 5 data visualisations. Through this project I gained experience with creating:
* radial graphs
* dumb bell graphs
* radar graphs
* maps

Below I'll take you through what I did to prepare the data and what findings emerged. See my Netflix Wrapped essay for an extended discussion on what transpired during in this project.

## Data prep
I consulted IMDB, pulled their 27 genre categories and created 2 new fields for genre category: a primary category and, in some cases, a secondary category for each title in my list. (One title represents a unique TV show or Movie title)

## Findings
My top 5 favourite genres were Comedy, Documentary, Drama, Game-shows, with Thrillers, Crime and Animation tied for fifth place.

## Data prep
Here I had to ensure I had clean and well-formatted data in the ‚Äòdate_watched‚Äô field of my dataframe. Additionally it was important to have a ‚Äòtitle‚Äô and an ‚Äòepisode_name‚Äô field to differentiate and enable me to count unique show or movie titles and unique episodes which may be part of a series. In hindsight I could have included additional field for ‚Äòseason‚Äô for cases where I watched multiple seasons of the same title, however the naming convention around this is not always consistent for example:

|Title                                                                                    |
