summary: "This was a predictive modelling project where a model was trained to predict the arrival time of a delivery."
---

This project used data from over 28 000 deliveries completed by Sendy in Nairobi, Kenya.
The dataset used to train the predictive model used 21 201 data points while the model was tested on 7 068 data points.
The aim was to optimise the model to improve the Mean Squared Error score. Travel time was measured in seconds.


Here is a summary of columns that are found in the dataset which represent the delivery attributes that can be used to predict delivery time:

```

1) I chose the 3 attributes below to include in the model as they had a more significant impact on the delivery time: 
- Day of the week - since traffic conditions on the weekend or weekday influence delivery times
- Precipitation - since rain will impact traffic congestion on the road system
- Distance - between the Sendy depot and the delivery destination

```cpp
train1 = train1[['Pickup_-_Weekday_(Mo_=_1)',
'Precipitation_in_millimeters','Distance_(KM)','Time_from_Pickup_to_Arrival' ]]

test1 = test1[['Pickup_-_Weekday_(Mo_=_1)',
'Precipitation_in_millimeters','Distance_(KM)']]
```

I streamlined the string values into numerical values in both the train and test data sets:

```cpp
#weekdays get a dummy value of 0
train1['Pickup_-_Weekday_(Mo_=_1)'] = train1['Pickup_-_Weekday_(Mo_=_1)'].replace([1,2,3,4,5],0)

#weekend days get a dummy value of 1
train1['Pickup_-_Weekday_(Mo_=_1)'] = train1['Pickup_-_Weekday_(Mo_=_1)'].replace([6,7],1)

#no rain day get dummy 0
train1['Precipitation_in_millimeters'] = train1['Precipitation_in_millimeters'].fillna(int(0))

#rain days get dummy 1 else 0
train1['Precipitation_in_millimeters'] = np.where(train1['Precipitation_in_millimeters'] > 0, 1, 0)

```

2) Model training using the training dataset:

```cpp
x = train1.drop('Time_from_Pickup_to_Arrival', axis=1)
y = train1['Time_from_Pickup_to_Arrival']
>>> n_samples, n_features = 10, 5

reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SGDRegressor(max_iter=1000, tol=1e-3))
reg.fit(X, y)

y_preds = reg.predict(X)
```

3) Next, I calculated the root mean squared error between the predicted delivery time and the actual delivery times:

```cpp
def rmse(y_test, y_predict):
  return np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_predict))
  
  answer = rmse(y, y_preds)
  answer
      794.4000853649443
```

4) Finally, I applied the model to predict delivery times on the test dataset:

```cpp
xt = test1.drop('Time_from_Pickup_to_Arrival', axis=1)

ytest_preds = reg.predict(xt)
       
daf = pd.DataFrame(ytest_preds, columns=['Time_from_Pickup_to_Arrival'])
daf.head()
  Time_from_Pickup_to_Arrival
0 	1418.709746
1 	1124.555383
2 	1124.555383
3 	1124.555383
4 	1222.606838
```

RMSE â‰ˆ 794 seconds (~13 minutes) suggests substantial error. To lower the RMSE, further tuning of the model can be applied such as including more attributes. Alternatively, a simpler linear regression model may be used if only 3 attributes will be used.
