### Genres watched

**Data prep**
My initial plan was to use an official Netflix API to pull the genre values for each title in my watch history but it turns out	there is no API because apparently in a letter to developers, Netflix explained that “To better focus our efforts and to align them with the needs of our global member base,” the company would shut down its public API. Reelgood could have stood in this gap but it was too costly to pay for. So instead I consulted IMDB, pulled the genre categories used in the filter feature and created 2 new fields for genre category. Finally I manually assigned a primary category and, in some cases, a secondary category for each title in my list.

As an aside, there might be some room for debate with IMDB about what differentiates a Thriller from a Mystery but I digress. I also briefly considered using the IMDB API but abandoned that idea because I thought it would slow me down and I was done with the manual categorisation of 121 titles in about 30 minutes.

Findings
My top 5 favourite genres were Comedy, Documentary, Drama, Game-shows, with Thrillers, Crime and Animation tied for fifth place. 

I had many internal debates about the categories and where some shows should go. For instance, is _Orange Is The New Black_ a crime, comedy, drama show? Is _Black Mirror_ perhaps a sci-fi, dark-comedy show? To what extent was _The Crown_ a historical documentary or a high-profile family-drama? And to all these question my answer is just, yes. It all applies. Much of my favourite content is layered and straddles multiple genres. I loved a good dramedy (drama + comedy) like _Pain Hustlers_ or _BEEF_ and was equally delighted by the unique comedy + mystery combo in movies like _They Cloned Tyrone_ and _Shimmer Lake_. 

With Documentaries being my 2nd favourite genre I appreciate Netflix’s ability to source and deliver compelling serialised documentaries. I was utterly fascinated by the depth and story-telling in _Free Money_, _MH370: The Plane That Disappeared_, _Beckham_, _Big Vape_ and _Senzo: Murder of a Soccer Star_ (desperately hoping season 2 of Senzo is on the way!).
